Question 1 Word count. A common utility on Unix/Linux systems is a small program called “wc.” This 
program analyzes a file to determine the number of lines, words, and characters contained therein. 
Write your own version of wc. The program should accept a file name as input and then print three 
numbers showing the count of lines, words, and characters in the file.
